# winejournal
Welcome to winejournal, the worlds worst wine note taking app. 

Well, it's the worst for now because right now this is mostly a sandbox to experiment with the [`Neo4j`](https://neo4j.com/) graph database and [`neomodel`](https://neomodel.readthedocs.io/) ORM.

The next step in the plan is to make a lightweight flask server with query-able REST endpoints and serve a basic React or Vue frontend.
